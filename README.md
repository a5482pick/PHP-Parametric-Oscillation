The motion of a system with two masses and three springs is plotted.  The (x,y) coordinates give the position of mass 1 and mass 2 respectively, when time advances along the plotted line.  The canvas automatically resizes and reappears when the window is resized, and the canvas is repositioned when the window is below a particular size.
See repository 'coupled-oscillators-analytic' for an animated visualisation.

(Two arrays to store the data points have been added.  Remove the 5 storage lines to speed the calculation up a bit if you won't be using them.)
